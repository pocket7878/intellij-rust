/**
 * Cargo based project's workspace abstraction insulating inter-op with the `cargo` & `Cargo.toml`
 * itself. Uses `cargo metadata` sub-command to update IDEA module's & project's model.
 *
 * Quite low-level in its nature & follows a soft-fail policy, i.e. provides access
 * for latest obtained instance of the [CargoWorkspace], though doesn't assure that this
 * one could be obtained (consider the case with invalid, or missing `Cargo.toml`)
 *
 * Updating project information is inherently asynchronous, however during the tests
 * all updates are executed synchronously on the EDT thread. This is needed because
 * the tests themselves use EDT, so any async update which tries to commit via a
 * WriteAction leads to a deadlock.
